# "Impacts of UV Radiation from an AGN on Planetary Atmospheres and Consequences for Galactic Habitability"
This Python notebook includes the code to generate all figures and info in tables from Sippy et al. (2025)--- except Tables 1 and 7 because those are just the inverse square law. I've marked where the data files I am loading from my computer came from throughout, so that should all be fully reproduceable. The source code for PALEO is publicly available on github (https://github.com/PALEOtoolkit), so the simulation outputs are also reproduceable (with some more effort).

This is all my original code, with the exception of some parts in the 'Plotting PALEO Simulation Outputs' section, which were borrowed from Jake Eager-Nash.
